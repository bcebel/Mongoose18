## Credits

I watched a MongoDB video by the company that walks through how to use Mongoose https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bALyYC10ABw&t=8s, I followed the tutorial and it helped recap the lesson for the week, plus the school documentation. Learning SQL was a huge plus to be able to pick up MongoDB a little faster
